                <p>I am working toward to get stronger in the weight room. I started this goal when i started playing football i needed to get stronger to play the position. My brother recommend to do freshman football because he said it was fun. I joined it and we started working out everyday which was new to me. I enjoyed so i wanted to get stronger and go up in weight. How im working on my goal is staying consistent going and working out even if i'm tired or don't feel like doing it. Another way i work toward my goal is finishing my sets on the workout and doing all the reps. I workout everyday but the weekends so my body can recover and start again on monday. Drinking a lot of water and eating healthy helps me recover even more and getting enough sleep. A short-term goal i hope to accomplish is my studies in school. I want to graduate high school and pass all my classes and get all my credits i need to graduate. The character traits and achievements i want to be known for is being a hardworking person, athletic person and a person that can get the job done.</p>
